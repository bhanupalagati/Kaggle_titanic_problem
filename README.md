# Kaggle_titanic_problem
This folder contain program of solving titanic problem in kaggle
Solution was written in python
Tested with all the classification models best score was recorded with random forest classifier
Total size of the test set is 223
when k nearest neighbours algorithm applied on it confussion matrix is
knn = 115,28,23,57  correct predictions are 172
when naive algorithm was applied
naive  = 109, 34, 17, 63 correct predictions are 172
when Decision Tree was applied
decision tree = 102, 41, 21, 59 correct predictions are 161
when svm is applied
svm = 116, 27, 22, 58 correct predictions are 174
when random forest is applied with various number of trees
random (10) = 121 22 25 55 correct predictions are 176
random (15) = 118 25 22 58 correct predictions are 176
random (100) =  118 25 24 56  correct predictions are 174


random forest with 10 trees is the best fitting algorithm so we have applied the learning algorithm on the train set
